   	<p>No matter where you go online, there is one thing that never changes, cat gifs. Cat gifs have been here forever and don't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
	<p>The only problem, it's the same gif over and over. It is always a cat jumping, sneezing, falling in water, or asking for a cheeseburger using terrible grammar.</p>
	<p>Why can't people post gifs of cats galloping, or running through obstacle courses? Obviously because cats can't do these things. Have you seen a horse sneeze? It's much more impreseive than a cat sneeze. This is why pony gifs are superior. </p>
